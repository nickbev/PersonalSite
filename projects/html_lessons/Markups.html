		<h1>Markups</h1>
		<h2>Doctypes</h2>
			<p>Doctypes are used to determine which version of HTML is used
			   by a page. This helps with other versions of computers. Also,
			   CSS uses this to help render a page correctly.
		<h2>Comments in HTML</h2>
			<!-- This cannot be seen on the webpage -->
			<p>Code that is in between carrots and a pair of dashes with an
			   exclamation mark in front cannot be seen on the page itself.
			<!-- However, it can be seen if looking at the source code 
			
			     behind the webpage.--></p>
		<h2>Class attribute</h2>
			<p class="important"> All elements can have a class, IMPORTANT</p>
			<p>This one has no class attribute. They look the same, but 				    with CSS you can change the color or font.</p>
		<h2>Block element</h2>
			<p>Elements such as headings, paragraphs, and lists always
			   start on a new line.</p>
		<h2>Inline element</h2>
			<p>Some elements such as em (<em>Example</em>) and b 					   (<b>Example</b>) continue on the same line.</p>
		<h2>Text and Elements in a Block</h2>
			<p>The div element allows you to put a set of elements together
			   in a one block-level box.</p>
			<div id="header">
				<img src="images/twain.jpg" alt="Mark Twain" />
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.cmgww.com/historic/twain/"
					  >Main Website</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/						      Mark_Twain">Wikipedia</a></li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		<h2>Text and Elements Inline</h2>
			<p>Instead of using div, when inline you want to use span. This is 			   usually used for <span class="gallery">editing</span>
			   this text using CSS.</p>
			</p>
		<h2>Iframes</h2>
			<p>Like a little window pasted onto your webpage, frames can be
			   taken form other pages and seen on yours, for example
			   Google Maps. You can also set its width and height.
			   You can also set whether you can scroll on the site or
			   have a border with scrolling and frameborder attributes.</p>
			<iframe
				src="http://ehs.edgemont.org/www/edgemont_ehs/site/hosting/pd/index.html"
				width="450"
				height="350"
				frameborder="1"
				scrolling="yes">
			</iframe>
		<h2>Page Information</h2>
			<p>Using the meta element allows information about the webpage.
		           Although not visible to the user, it tells engines about the
			   page and usually has name and content attributes. Some 				   usable variables include description, keywords, robots, author,
			   pragma, and expires.</p>
			<meta name="description"
				content="My program" />
			<meta name="keywords"
				content="html, frames, info" />
			<meta name="robots"
				content="nofollow" /> <!-- search engines should not add 					                    this page -->
			<meta http-equiv="author"
				content="Nick Bevacqua" />
			<meta http-equiv="pragma"
				content="no-cache" /> <!-- prevents caching -->
			<meta http-equiv="expires"
				content="Fri 06 Jun 2014 23:59:59 EDT" />
		<h2>Escape characters</h2>
			<p>Many characters that typically cannot appear on a webpage
			   have particular series of symbols and letters to have it
			   appear. Examples: &lt; &copy; &trade;</p>
