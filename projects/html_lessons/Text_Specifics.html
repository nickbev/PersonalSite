		<h1>Other Ways to Manipulate Text</h1>
		<p>You can use strong to show <strong>importance</strong> of a word or 
		   phrase, which typically is seen as bolded by default.</p>
		<p>Similarly, you can use em to show <em>emphasis</em> which is default 		    seen as italics.</p>
		<blockquote cite=“http://google.com”>
		<p>This is a use of block quote for longer quotes that come from another 		website, and are seen as indented.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>A more direct way to use quotations is with q, which places a pair of 
		   <q>quotation marks</q> between the calls.</p>
		<p>By using the abbr element, you can simplify acronyms with information 		   about their full name. (Example = <abbr title=“Edgemont High 			   School”>EHS</abbr>).</p>
	 	<p>When citing a source, you use cite, which usually appears as italics   		   (Example = <cite>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</cite>).</p>
		<p>To give an address, you can use hCard and address (Example: <a 			   href=“nickbevacqua@me.com”>nickbevacqua@me.com)</a> <br />
		   44 Midvale Road, Hartsdale NY. </p>
		<p>You can use del and ins to show <del>currictions</del> 				   <ins>corrections</ins>.</p>
		<p>Another way to cross out is with s (<s>$100</s> now $90).</p>
