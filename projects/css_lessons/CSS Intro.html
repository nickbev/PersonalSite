		<h2>Understanding CSS</h2>
			<p>Imagine every HTML element surrounded by an invisible box.</p>
			<p>CSS creates rules that control how each box (and their 				   contents) is presented.</p>
			<p>You can make box changes (width, height, borders, colors, 			 	   position) and text ((typeface, size, color, upper + lowercase)			   and other specific examples.</p>
		<h2>Structure and Effects of CSS</h2>
			<p>CSS rules have two parts: a selector and a declaration.</p>
			<p>Following the single or multiple (with commas between) 				   elements,  you use brackets where between you set 					   properties and their respective values.</p>
		<h2>External CSS</h2>
			<p>In the head element where the title goes, you make a link				   element to the CSS document.</p>
			<p>You also use the href attribute for the path, the type			    	   attribute for document (text/css) and rel for its relationship 			   (stylesheet).</p>
		<h2>Internal CSS</h2>
			<p>You can also create CSS within an HTML document using the style
			   element. You must have the attribute type with value text/css 			   to indicate it is CSS.</p>
			<p>This is only more efficient when applying a style to one page. 			   If you have multiple pages with the same formatting, you should 			   have a separate css document to reference.</p>
		<h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
			<p>Using various commands you can pick particular elements within
			   an HTML document for particular CSS rules to be applied.</p>
		<h2>CSS Rules Cascade</h2>

		<h2>Inheritance</h2>
