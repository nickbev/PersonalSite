		<h2>Eggplant Parmigiana</h2>
		<p>Step 1: Drain the tomatoes well, and cook them with the minced onion and a sprig of basil. When they have softened, drain them and put them through a food mill, then cook them a little more over low heat, without letting the sauce thicken too much. Salt the sauce when it is done and dont add oil, as the eggplant will have absorbed enough in frying.</p>
